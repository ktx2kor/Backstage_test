1.1. Vision: 
We have a common BBM product strategy and understanding over all BUs with which we derive actions towards a sound implementation. We are x times more efficient and x times faster!

1.2. Motivation:
Siloed BU development & Operation
Lack of transparency on SW asset across Business Units
Duplicate solutions across Business Units
Difficulty in provisioning consistent environments
Higher operating cost from development to operations of software and services due to lack of reuse
1.3. Strategy
We cluster with a common architecture and define common APIs. Enabling mobility transformation to target modular (& common) SW architecture for products across BUs.

1.4. The Solution
Digital Warehouse is a transformative platform designed to centralize asset information across business units (BUs) enabling asset discovery for reuse. This initiative aligns with the company's vision to increase speed & cost efficiency in mobility software and services domains (Embedded, Compute & Offboard).

Value it brings to mobility company by enabling:

Breaking silos
Improving Operational efficiency
Transformation Alignment, Fostering collaboration
USPs:

Transparency on internal and external (product) assets
Supports harmonization and reuse for the product development domain or archetypes (Onboard/Offboard)
Enable Mobility Company to build on common reference architectures and exchangeable building blocks
Caters to specific needs like SBOM generation, OSS & Vulnerability Management, Errata Management, etc.
